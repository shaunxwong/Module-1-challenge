# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Accessible Website Overhaul

## The Journey Begins!

I'm thrilled to dive into the first challenge of this course! It was time to put my web development skills to the test.

## My Journey

My Journey is to refactor the codebase, making it more accessible without altering its functionality. The ultimate goal is to meet accessibility standards and optimize the site for search engines.

In this scenario my lead has provided specific criteria for this project. While meeting the requirements, I should also aim to impress the clients by going above and beyond. Improving the codebase for long-term sustainability is essential. I'll pay attention to details like functional links, consolidated and organized CSS selectors and properties, and well-commented code.

Let's dive into the requirements that I've needed fulfill:

## My User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
